                    <h3>Tampa, the "Big Guava"</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Big Guava is a nickname for Tampa, Florida, United States. It was coined in the 1970s by Steve Otto, long-time newspaper columnist for the Tampa Tribune and Tampa Times.
                        The moniker derives from a combination of New York's "Big Apple" nickname and a reference to businessman Gavino Gutierrez's unsuccessful quest for wild guava trees, which turned out to be vital to Tampa's growth and development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1884, Gavino Gutierrez, a Spanish-American civil engineer by training who was working for a tropical fruit packing firm in New York, heard a rumor that wild guava trees were common near the Tampa Bay area on the west coast of Florida. 
                        Thinking that the fruit could be gathered and serve as a new product source for his company, Gutierrez accompanied the owner of his firm on a fact-finding mission to Tampa.

                        <p>
                            The first Blind Tiger Cafe started in Ybor City, a small historic, cigar city in Tampa, Florida. The founders had a desire to bring great roasted coffee flavors back to a city that was known for its historic richness. Inspired by the tailored and craftsman feel of a speakeasy, the founders wanted to start a Blind Tiger (another name for speakeasy) of their own. They wanted to sell quality, original roasts so great tasting, it would seem illegal. 
                            The Blind Tiger is a speakeasy-inspired lifestyle brand for those who desire quality and richness in the small pleasures of life.

                            That's what excellent coffee is about too, not edginess or snobbiness. Our "Brew Good, Do Good" mission is just that: nourishing the global coffee ecosystem and our local communities through the simple joy of a great cup of coffee. 
                            The best of the best specialty grade coffees, ethically and sustainably sourced from around the world and artfully roasted to bring out the unique and amazing characteristics of each lot — crop to cup — just for you. Coffee is what we do. Love is why we do it.

                        <p>
                            We believe in quality. We source our green, pre-roasted beans according to the best taste and complexity. 
                            We also believe in quality people. We deliver your delicious cup of coffee along with the story of the people who made it possible.

                            I've been a coffee lover years before any specialty roasters existed in the area. But one night, everything changed. 
                            My brother-in-law and I tasted a new kind of coffee. Because of that night of freshly roasted and ground coffee, we bought a small drum roaster the very next day. 
                            We installed it in his garage and proceeded to blow our minds and pallets. I was now obsessed with what coffee could and should taste like when it is treated with the care it deserves.
                            I believe we were born to create, and coffee is how I express that. I also believe Elevation Coffee Roasters can be the outlet for others to create. 
                            Maybe you're a barista trying something new, or a regular customer working on your novel. For you, Elevation is your launch pad.
